# SwiftTDS (TDS Implementation)

Non-blocking, event-driven Swift implementation of the [Tabular Data Stream (TDS) Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tds/1ef08b76-1594-40cf-8ce0-d2407133dd3d) built on top of [SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio).

This package provides a client implementation of the TDS protocol, with functionality for connecting to, authorizing, and querying instances of Microsoft's SQL Server. 

**It is currenlty under active development and is an incomplete implementation of the protocol.**
